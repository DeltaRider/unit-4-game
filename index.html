In dook&eacute;land, dook&eacute;mon can be observed at all hours of the night participating in their own micro economy.  This micro economy sees cash flow from normal society into dook&eacute;land, through dook&eacute;land, and eventually back out to corporate America.  It's one big game where the Crackhead collects money from city dwellers (non-dook&eacute;mon) passing through or parking in dook&eacute;land. The Drug Dealer sells drugs to, and collects money from the Crackhead.  The Drug Dealer uses that money to pay for the Hoes. The Hoes give their money to the Pimp, and the Pimp eventually gets the Crackhead's dook&eacute; on his clothes. This forces the Pimp to buy new clothes from corporate America outside of dook&eacute;land, thus completing the full lifecycle of money flowing through dook&eacute;land's micro economy.  This is the game of dook&eacute;mon...</p>

            <p id="bottomtext">Rules of the Game</p>
            <p id="bottomtext">- You will choose 1 out of the 4 dook&eacute;mon as your fighting character.  You have a choice between the Crackhead, Drug Dealer, Hoe, or Pimp.  You can evaluate each dook&eacute;mon's playing card before making your choice.</p>
            <p id="bottomtext">- The dook&eacute;mon you choose will take on the other 3 dook&eacute;mon in an attempt to be the last one standing with money.</p>
            <p id="bottomtext">- Choose the order in which you take on the other dook&eacute;mon wisely. Each dook&eacute;mon has a special economic relationship with the other.  No two relationships are the same.</p>
            <p id="bottomtext">- Press the spacebar to begin.  Good Luck!</p>
