            <p id="toptext">Deep in the heart of San Francisco's Tenderloin Distict, lives the </p><h1 style="display: inline; font-family: maintext;">dook&eacute;mon</h1><p id="toptext"> in their natural habitat, also known as </p><h2 style="display: inline;font-family: maintext;">dook&eacute;land</h2><p id="toptext">.  In dook&eacute;land, dook&eacute;mon can be observed at all hours of the night trading money back and fourth with each other in their own micro economy.  The sole purpose of their existence is to try and gather as much of each others money without going broke themselves.  It's somewhat of a Rat Race, or game, where the Crackhead collects money from non-dook&eacute;mon city dwellers passing through dook&eacute;land, and in turn gives that money to the Drug Dealer.  The Drug Dealer sells drugs to and collects money from Crackhead so he can pay for the Hoes, while the Hoes give their money to the Pimp.  The Pimp eventually gets the Crackhead's dook&eacute; on his clothes and needs to go shopping for new clothes outside of dook&eacute;land, thus completing the full lifecycle of money flowing through dook&eacute;land's micro economy.  This is the game of dook&eacute;mon.</p>
